# March 2019 Coding Challenge

## Pi in the Sky

The challenge is to solve the [Pi in the Sky Challenge](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/nasapidaychallenge/)
from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

## Notes

It's aimed at students, but is a fun little challenge that makes you remember
some math concepts you may  not have used in awhile.
