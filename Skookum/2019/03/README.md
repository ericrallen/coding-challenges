# March 2019 Coding Challenge

## Pi in the Sky

The challenge is to solve the [Pi in the Sky Challenge](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/nasapidaychallenge/)
from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

## Notes

It's aimed at students, but is a fun little challenge that makes you remember
some math concepts you may  not have used in awhile.

JavaScript is not great when you get into math involving units and conversions.
I'm sure someone has created a library for dealing with that stuff, but it is
pretty hard to keep track of it without any helper libraries.
