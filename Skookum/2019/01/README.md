# January 2019 Coding Challenge

## JS Assessment

The challenge is to complete the [js-asessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment).

You can find my solutions at [my js-assessment fork](https://github.com/ericrallen/js-assessment)

## Notes

I cheated in a few places because I'd end up looking up the code if they ever came up in the real world, too. I still don't really *get* currying.
